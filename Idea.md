I have trust and estate documents which consists of wills, codicils, trust and amendments. How to make a structured flowchart of complete estate disposition flow using python and LLM . Also, how to make a knowledge graph of the same which can be used for reasoning RAG questions.
Generating a structured flowchart and knowledge graph for estate disposition using Python and LLMs
Here's a breakdown of how to approach building a structured flowchart of estate disposition and a knowledge graph for reasoning with your trust and estate documents (wills, codicils, trusts, and amendments) using Python and LLMs:
I. Structured flowchart of estate disposition
1. Data Extraction and Pre-processing:
Parse Documents: Use libraries like PyPDF2 (for PDFs) or custom parsers for other document formats to extract the text content of your wills, codicils, and trusts.
Identify Key Information:
Named Entities: Use an LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5, Llama) with a custom prompt to identify and extract key entities like beneficiaries, executors/trustees, guardians, specific assets, and distribution percentages/conditions.
Relationships: Extract relationships between entities, such as "bequeaths," "holds in trust for," "names as executor," etc..
Conditional Statements: Identify any conditional clauses, such as "if [beneficiary] predeceases," "upon reaching age [age]," etc.
Events: Look for events like death, reaching a specific age, marriage, etc.. 
2. Flowchart Generation:
Structure the Disposition Logic: This is where the LLM is crucial. You can prompt the LLM to analyze the extracted information and describe the estate disposition in a step-by-step manner, outlining the flow of assets to beneficiaries, potentially handling different scenarios based on conditions.
Example Prompt: "Based on the provided will and trust documents, describe the complete estate disposition flow step-by-step, including conditional transfers and asset distributions. Outline the process from the death of the testator to the final distribution to beneficiaries."
Represent as a Flowchart Description Language: Ask the LLM to generate the flowchart description in a language like PlantUML or Mermaid, which can be easily rendered into visual flowcharts.
Example PlantUML Prompt: "Represent the following estate disposition flow in PlantUML syntax, using appropriate nodes for actions and decisions, and edges for flow: [Detailed step-by-step description generated in the previous step]."
Python for Rendering: Use Python libraries to render the generated PlantUML or Mermaid code into a visual flowchart.
Mermaid: Use libraries like PyExecJS to execute the JavaScript Mermaid library within Python to render the diagrams.
Graphviz (for PlantUML/DOT): Graphviz can also be used to render the flowchart from the PlantUML or DOT syntax generated by the LLM. 
II. Knowledge graph for reasoning RAG questions
1. Entity and Relationship Extraction (Reinforced):
Refine LLM Prompts: Further refine your prompts to the LLM to extract a more granular set of entities (e.g., specific clauses, dates, addresses, legal terms) and relationships (e.g., "Clause A overrides Clause B," "Trust X applies to assets in Location Y").
Validate and Clean Extracted Data: Implement validation steps and potential entity disambiguation (merging duplicate entities) to ensure the extracted information is accurate and consistent, as LLMs can sometimes produce unpredictable outputs. 
2. Knowledge Graph Construction:
Graph Database (e.g., Neo4j): Store the extracted entities as nodes and relationships as edges in a graph database like Neo4j.
Define a Schema: Establish a clear schema for your knowledge graph, defining the types of nodes (e.g., Person, Asset, Trust, Will, Clause) and relationships (e.g., BENEFICIARY_OF, EXECUTOR_OF, OWNS, HOLDS_IN_TRUST, AFFECTS, OVERRIDES). 
3. Reasoning with RAG Questions:
RAG Architecture: Implement a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system where the knowledge graph serves as the retrieval source.
Querying the Knowledge Graph: When a user asks a question about the estate documents, formulate a query to the knowledge graph to retrieve relevant information.
Example Queries: "Who is the primary beneficiary of the trust?", "What happens to the estate if Beneficiary A dies before the testator?", "Which assets are subject to the will vs. the trust?"
LLM for Response Generation: Use an LLM to synthesize the retrieved information from the knowledge graph and generate a coherent and accurate answer to the user's question.
Contextualization: The knowledge graph provides context and helps ensure the LLM's response is grounded in the legal documents, mitigating the risk of hallucination.
Natural Language to Graph Queries: Consider using LLMs to translate natural language questions into graph queries (e.g., Cypher queries for Neo4j) to streamline the retrieval process. 
Challenges and best practices
LLM Accuracy and Bias: Be mindful of the potential for LLM inaccuracies and biases, especially in a legal context. Human review and validation are essential.
Domain Expertise: Fine-tuning the LLM with legal documents and estate planning concepts can improve its performance in this specific domain.
Scalability: Consider the scalability of your approach, particularly when dealing with large numbers of documents or complex estate plans.
Open-Source LLMs: Explore using open-source LLMs that can be fine-tuned and deployed locally to maintain data privacy and control.
Evaluation: Establish metrics and procedures to evaluate the accuracy and completeness of your generated flowcharts and knowledge graphs, as well as the effectiveness of your RAG system. 
By combining the power of Python for document processing and visualization with the advanced language understanding and generation capabilities of LLMs, you can create a comprehensive system to analyze your trust and estate documents, visualize the estate disposition flow, and enable intelligent querying and reasoning.
